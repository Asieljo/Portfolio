        <h1>CASE STUDY: DIGITAL CATALOG FOR A SMALL COMPANY</h1>
        <section class="meet_section">
            <h2>1. Meeting the client</h2>
            <p>I met with a client who owned a small company. He told me he had a problem: for quotes, he needed to visit clients' houses, take measurements, find the materials, and, with all that information, estimate the quote including materials and labor. Of course, this required a lot of time, gas, and effort—and he is an elderly man. So he needed a quote app to have all the necessary information for the clients and they quickly order an installation.</p>
            <p>I identified the main problem and found a different solution: <b>a Digital Catalog where clients can check out the prices of differents installations including materials costs, labor prices and more. Some actions on the client´s side include providing measures of their installation space.</b></p>

        <section class="segmentation_section">
            <h2>2. User´s Segmentation</h2>
            <p>First of all, I segmented the users in different categories:<br>
                <b>Types of users</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Principal users:</b> The company owner</li>
                    <li><b>Secondary users:</b> Workers that help with installations and need to be informed about it</li>
                    <li><b>Clients:</b> All the people that want to find quotes of installations, materials costs, labor prices and more</li>    
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>User´s characteristics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>User 1:</b> Small company that doesn´t have a high budget and requires a efficient solution</li>
                    <li><b>User 2:</b> Clients that want a quick way to get a quote of their installation (all included)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="sketching_section">
            <h2>3. Sketching</h2>
            <p>
                With the solution in mind, i started creating sketches and drawings of the structure, styles and user flow. I constantly came up with great ideas but at the end i discarded them. After multiple discarded ideas and concepts i found the perfect option for the catalog.

        </section>
        <section class="userflow_section">
            <h2>4. User Flow & Sitemap</h2>
            <p>After the sketches, i went to Figma. I created the main User flow and the Roadmap, based on what i draw. I created all the necessary components and forms (i was helped with some plugins that are amazing!).</p>
            <div class="assets">

        <section class="wireframing_section">
            <h2>5. Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                Then, i did my favorite part. I created multiple components, interactive components, variants and assets. Using all those elements, i designed various interactive wireframes. Once i verified that everything worked correctly i transformed those wireframes into a more realistic design.

            <h2>6. Stuck project</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the project was halted because the client didn´t meet with me to review the next steps. However, i deeply appreciate this experience because it allowed me to learn how to engage with clients and practice everything i learned.
